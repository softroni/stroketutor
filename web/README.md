# StrokeTutor Web

Browser player for interactive "learn to draw on paper" tutorials, and the surface
tutorials are authored and tested on before they ship to the iOS app.

Both apps read the same JSON — literally the same files, in [`../shared`](../shared).
The schema, the golden tutorials and the conformance corpus live there and are read
by this app and by the iOS target; neither side keeps a copy. `src/player/svgPath.ts`
is a port of `StrokeTutor/Parsing/SVGPathParser.swift` — same grammar, same
rejections, same character indices in error messages.

What keeps the two honest is `shared/conformance/`: a corpus of documents with the
verdict each player must reach, run by `npm test` here and by `ConformanceTests.swift`
there. Where the two are meant to differ, the manifest says so and says why. See
[shared/README.md](../shared/README.md).

## Running

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # opens the House sample with step one animating
npm test         # path parser + shared conformance corpus
npm run build    # type-check and bundle
```

No backend, no network calls, no accounts. Everything runs offline.

## Layout

```
../shared/            tutorial.schema.json, Tutorials/, conformance/   (also read by iOS)
src/
  schema/    types.ts, validate.ts          mirrors and enforces the shared schema
  player/    TutorialPlayer.tsx, StrokeCanvas.tsx, usePlayback.ts, svgPath.ts
  app/       App.tsx, TutorialSource.tsx, DebugPanel.tsx
  samples/   index.ts                       loads the golden files from ../shared
```

`@shared/*` resolves to `../shared/*` — see the alias in `vite.config.ts` and the
matching `paths` entry in `tsconfig.json`.

`player/` imports nothing from `app/`. `TutorialPlayer` takes a validated `Tutorial`
and nothing else, so a future editing UI can wrap it unchanged.

## Loading a tutorial

Four ways, all ending in the same validation path:

- the bundled samples,
- a `.json` file picker,
- dropping a `.json` file anywhere on the window,
- pasting JSON into the textarea and pressing **Load** — the quickest way to test
  AI-generated or hand-edited documents.

A document that fails validation is reported with its JSON path
(`steps[2].strokes[0].d`), the reason, and the offending value. The last document
that loaded cleanly stays on the canvas; the player never goes blank without saying
why.

## Playback

`idle → drawing(step) → awaitingUser(step) → drawing(next) → … → finished`

Strokes animate with the dash-offset technique, driven by `requestAnimationFrame`
and an explicit progress value rather than a CSS transition, so scrubbing and speed
changes land on the frame they are asked for. Progress is a fraction of the stroke's
*duration*, never of its length: two strokes with equal durations take equal time
however long their paths are, which is what makes timing parity with iOS checkable.

Strokes within a step are strictly sequential. Completed steps stay on the paper at
0.3 opacity; upcoming steps are not drawn at all. A speed change applies from the
next stroke, leaving the one in flight on its original clock.

## Debug panel

For hand-authoring coordinates: show-all rendering, a 100-unit grid with axis
labels, a live canvas-space cursor readout, and a stroke inspector listing every
stroke's `d`, duration and measured path length — hover a row to pick that stroke
out on the canvas. It renders its own static canvas next to the live player, so you
can read coordinates off a still copy while the animation plays.

## Schema v1

`shared/tutorial.schema.json` is the source of truth and validates every document
that is loaded; `types.ts` mirrors it. `canvas` maps directly to the SVG
`viewBox`, and coordinates and `lineWidth` are in canvas units. `style` is optional
and defaults to `#2B2B2B` on `#FAF7F0`; colours are `#RRGGBB` or `#RRGGBBAA` with the
`#` optional, matching what iOS `Color(hex:)` accepts — three-digit `#RGB` is refused
because the device would silently draw the default instead. `voiceover` is always
`null` in v1 and is ignored — there is no audio. A `schemaVersion` other than `1` is
rejected by name.

Paths support absolute `M`, `L`, `C`, `Q` and `Z` only. Commas or whitespace
separate numbers, and one command letter may carry repeated coordinate sets
(`L 10 10 20 20` is two segments). Lowercase `z` is accepted; any other lowercase
command is rejected rather than misrendered as absolute.
